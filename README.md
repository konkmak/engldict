Language learning is hard. Especially because words can have ambiguous meanings.
One solution might be to learn a word only in the context of an example sentence.

This program will be a bit similar to [GnuVocabTrain](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuVocabTrain), but it will be open source
and work on all platforms.


Featuring the [most common english words project](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english) by [first20hours](https://github.com/first20hours).


I also need a good API to query example sentences for words.
The first thing that came to mind was Wiktionary, but the API was horrendous.
Therefore I wrote a scraper for [Vocaboly](http://www.vokaboly.de/bs/index.php) to get example sentences.
