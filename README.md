Dabblings into language learning
Let's see if we can create an easier learning program.

Featuring the [most common english words project](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english) by [first20hours](https://github.com/first20hours).

Language learning is hard. Especially because words can have ambiguous meanings.
One solution might be to a word only in the context of an example sentence.
For that, I need a good API to query words for example usage.
Currently I'm thinking of wiktionary but maybe I find something better.
